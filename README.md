# armenian_language_autocomplete

This repository is a part of my "Armenian Language Available - ALA" project, it is a volunteer based idea (no fundings yet).
The final goal of this "Armenian Language AutoComplete - ALAC" repository is to have a library of Armenian language words.
Later it is going to be used as a main source of Armenian words for implementing ideas related to NLP (subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence). 
The library is simple, it represents "word" -> "words usage percentage" taken from paragraph. 
The text paragraph is taken from websites written in Armenian language.

ALA project is a big idea of making various type of sources for Armenian language users, so that everyone who wants to deal with Armenian language can freely use it.
The goal of ALA is to make Armenian language sources publicily available, here "sources" means any type of text, starting from paper based books ending with electronic dictionaries and extensions.
To achieve this goal I separate ALA into different repositories, such as ALAC which is a libary of Armenian words, here words are any type of word which doesn't include space/probel, that is words even with conjugation of phrases.
